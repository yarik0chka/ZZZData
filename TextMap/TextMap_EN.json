  "Chat_Chapter0_02_08": "Yep.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_02_09": "I'd love to help! You managers are one of the main reasons I've been thriving here on Sixth Street.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_02_10": "But.. I need some materials to tune things up.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_02_11": "I had to get rid of all my Ether-sensitive materials last time there was a Public Security inspection.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_02_12": "Can you come up with some materials yourself?",
  "Chat_Chapter0_02_13": "Alright.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_02_14": "Great! Come back any time once you've got all the stuff.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_03_01": "Welcome to Tipsy Muse!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_03_02": "Hey, you're back! Did you get that Ether?",
  "Chat_Chapter0_03_03": "Yep.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_03_04": "Can you help me tune things up?",
  "Chat_Chapter0_03_05": "Leave it to me.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_04_01": "Argh, how annoying!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_04_02": "What's up, Chop?",
  "Chat_Chapter0_04_03": "Are you closed today?",
  "Chat_Chapter0_04_04": "Oh it's you, {NICKNAME}.\nSorry, but I can't take your order right now. Don't blame me, blame Pegasus Logistics!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_04_05": "The ingredients I ordered haven't arrived yet. I ran a track and trace on the order, and they somehow sent everything into a Hollow!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_04_06": "I couldn't reach the courier driver, so had to post a commission on the Proxy Network.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_05_01": "Oh, {NICKNAME} — you're back! Would you like a bowl of noodles?",
  "Chat_Chapter0_05_02": "Huh? You've opened up the shop again?",
  "Chat_Chapter0_05_03": "Haha, of course! My urgent order for ingredients just came through, so I'm ready to go!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_05_04": "About that commission...",
  "Chat_Chapter0_05_05": "Oh yeah! About that... I figured someone else would pick up the commission. I never thought you'd take care of everything so soon! If I'd known that, I'd have just gone directly to you for help.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_06_01": "Ah, you're back, {NICKNAME}!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_06_01F": "Just in time, {NICKNAME}. Nicole just contacted me.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_06_02": "Nicole just told me they've found some clues about where the strongbox is and they're heading over to the parking lot now.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_06_03": "I've already retrieved the data from the damaged flash drive. Looks like we can move on to the next phase now!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_06_04": "Get some prep work done before Nicole and the others get here. Program your Bangboo plug-ins over on the Workbench, or check out Hollow unlock conditions.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_06_05": "If everything's ready, head over to the parking lot and meet up with Nicole and her team!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_07_01": "This place is really hot these days for selling videotapes.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_07_02": "What do you recommend?",
  "Chat_Chapter0_08_01": "What a pain! How on earth did things tune out like this?",
  "Chat_Chapter0_08_02": "Do you have any videotapes of the kind that could help me out?",
  "Chat_ViceCharacterNPCDefault_Male_01": "It's better if you let your brother figure this out.",
  "Chat_ViceCharacterNPCDefault_Female_01": "It's better if you let your sister figure this out.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_09_01": "That's right — this videotape of yours right here.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_09_02": "I'll leave this in your capable hands, then!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_10_01": "I'm a little embarrassed to ask, but... how are things coming along?",
  "Chat_Chapter0_10_02": "I'll definitely be buying more tapes once everything's done!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_11_01": "Alright, it's tuned now.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_11_02": "Ferocious and terrifying Ethereals, born from Ether and the most deadly of Hollow foes.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_11_03": "But these \"rhythms\" extracted from their own supply can in turn be used as a kind of weapon against them.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_11_04": "Is that called... a natural counter? Perhaps the Hollow has more in common with our own nature than we thought.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_11_05": "Perhaps.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_11_06": "Goodbye, my storekeeper friend. Come back to the Tipsy Muse any time, even if it's just for the tunes.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_20_01": "What's the point of this damn movie? It's not scary at all. It'll send you to sleep!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_21_01": "Mmm! It's a classic story. Please recommend me something similar, if you have it.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_21_02": "Watching videos isn't enough, though. I need more stories to attract more pupils! Otherwise, the \"X-Files Club\" will have to disband...",
  "Chat_Chapter1_21_03": "Speaking of which, there's lots of weird stuff in the Hollows. If someone takes the commission I posted to the \"Proxy Network\" and came back with awesome stories, that'd be great!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_22_01": "Videotapes... the weird Hollow stuff... what other sources of inspiration are there out there?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_23_01": "Weird Hollow stuff won't do... without the \"conductor\", the tracks will keep disappearing like this due to the Ether...",
  "Chat_Chapter1_23_02": "Argh! The \"X-Files Club\" really is going to fold!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_24_01": "This isn't the movie I'm looking for. I wanna see something uplifting and soothing for the soul...",
  "Chat_Chapter1_25_01": "Oh... I don't know what \"Sausage\" is like. I can just get Proxy info from watching videotapes.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_25_02": "Sausage?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_25_03": "Doesn't sound like it's meant for eating.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_25_04": "Oh! \"Sausage\" is my pet dachshund. He wondered off into the Hollow a few days ago...",
  "Chat_Chapter1_25_05": "I put jobs up on the Proxy Network to find him, but nobody wants the job... so I've just been watching similar videos to pass the time.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_25_06": "But they all just make me miss \"Sausage\" more and more...",
  "Chat_Chapter1_26_01": "I hope \"Sausage\" is OK... Could there be a kind soul out there who's already rescued him from the Hollow?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_27_01": "Hi! I'm back to return my tape.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_27_02": "How's \"Sausage\"?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_27_03": "Any bites for your Proxy commission?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_27_04": "Ah yes, that's right. Someone actually did take on that commission to find \"Sausage\".",
  "Chat_Chapter1_27_05": "This morning when I opened up, a Bangboo was just sitting there with \"Sausage\"'s pet tag hung on it.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_27_06": "Hang on. \"Sausage\" isn't a Bangboo?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_27_07": "Wait up — what exactly is \"Sausage\"?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_27_08": "My \"Sausage\" is just a normal dog. But whatever... this must be fate, y'know? I've decided to keep this Bangboo and call it \"Sausage\". I ain't losing you again!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_27_09": "Anyway, the tag's a bit too small, so I ordered a new one...",
  "Chat_Chapter1_28_01": "No way! Those are trash. Let me find a disaster movie with a tragic ending...",
  "Chat_Chapter1_29_01": "Hmm... this movie should appeal to him.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_29_02": "The person this appeals to...",
  "Chat_Chapter1_29_03": "Are you watching together with someone?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_29_04": "My son loves watching Hollow thrillers and always harps on about questing there in real life. But the Hollow is dangerous — they can't portray them like that! Someone's gonna get hurt one day!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_29_05": "I put up a commission on the Proxy Network asking a pro to shoot a short movie and show my son what a Hollow REALLY looks like!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_29_06": "You can show him this tape here before you get your short movie made.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_30_01": "Those tarted-up special effect Hollows mask the true danger and should be banned!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_30_02": "Don't you agree, boss? You don't have any of those movies here at your store, right?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_31_01": "My son, he watched the whole thing without saying a word. He must be scared straight! Thank you so much for the recommendation!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_31_02": "It's the least I can do.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_31_03": "Can a videotape alone really change this kid's mind?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_31_04": "That's right, I downloaded your short movie from the Proxy. It's blisteringly real. Show him that!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_31_05": "I trust he'll never talk about any Hollow with me ever again!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_32_01": "There's no action; no blood! Haven't you got anything better?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_33_01": "Alright — this one! I'll show dad what the Hollows are really like!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_33_02": "Are you borrowing this for your father?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_33_03": "Your goal is to one day quest in the Hollow?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_33_04": "Yeah! Dad just keeps yapping on about all the danger and risk there, saying there's nothing in there but disaster. That can't be true!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_33_05": "This videotape alone won't do. He'll just say that everything's fake and that everyone's acting.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_33_06": "I put up a commission on the Proxy Network and will score some real footage soon. I can't wait to see his face then!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_34_01": "Hollows are brimming with fortune and opportunity. Don't you think so too, boss?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_34_02": "I believe all of those amazing action plots have to be based off of something. Art imitates life!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_35_01": "Heya! I'm just returning a tape. This movie was so fantastic that I had to watch it three times!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_35_02": "Rounding up, it sounds like you borrowed it for yourself.",
  "Chat_Chapter1_35_03": "What about the short film in the Hollow?",
  "Chat_Chapter1_35_04": "That short film was even better than this tape! All the rare loot everywhere was so dazzling. I got jealous watching everyone stuffing their pockets!",
  "Chat_Chapter1_35_05": "Heehee, I can't wait to go hunt for some treasure in there. Dad's got no grounds for stopping me any more!",
  "Chat_PasserBy_01_01": "I have to say, this store is utterly fascinating.\nI've never seen anywhere else like it in all of New Eridu.",
  "Chat_PasserBy_02_01": "Ah, I don't need an introduction, I'm just browsing...",
  "Chat_PasserBy_03_01": "Work is so boring... Time to find something fun to watch.",
  "Chat_PasserBy_04_01": "I wonder if I can find some old classics from back when I was a kid...",
  "Chat_PasserBy_05_01": "It would be perfect if I could just buy the whole store! I want to take my time watching everything there is here.",
  "Chat_PasserBy_06_01": "I've been through the whole store a few times but can't find that tape I wanted. Someone else must have borrowed it. Dammit...",
  "Chat_PasserBy_07_01": "I love this store! There're loads of choices and no crowds, unlike the cinema... Plus, it's cheap!",
  "Chat_PasserBy_08_01": "I'm not actually sure myself what I want to watch... \nI've only walked past this store before and couldn't help sticking my head inside.",
  "Chat_PasserBy_09_01": "I've basically watched everything I want to. Guess I could revisit something...\nI've come all this way, after all. Might as well not go home empty-handed.",
  "Chat_PasserBy_10_01": "I wanna open up a video store just like this when I grow up! Feels great to have a treasure vault like this.",
  "PasserByChat1_01": "How much revision have you done on your Ether activation this time around?",
  "PasserByChat1_02": "Nothing at all.",
  "PasserByChat1_03": "You always say that... but why is it always me who ends up revising?!",
  "PasserByChat2_01": "Any plans for the weekend?",
  "PasserByChat2_02": "I want to watch the Starlight Knight video...",
  "PasserByChat2_03": "Don't you have any other hobbies? Go outside for a walk some time, sheesh.",
  "PasserByChat2_04": "OK, let's go to the Starlight Store and buy some Starlight Knight models!",
  "PasserByChat3_01": "Is there any way to make me popular overnight?",
  "PasserByChat3_02": "Um... by collecting the full set of Starlight Knight badges?",
  "PasserByChat3_03": "I mean, popular with the ladies!",
  "PasserByChat4_01": "There have been lots of Hollow disasters these days. Things feel unsettled here in New Eridu.",
  "PasserByChat4_02": "Hasn't it always been the same old mess?",
  "PasserByChat4_03": "Well, that's true.",
  "PasserByChat5_01": "Well, that's interesting...",
  "PasserByChat5_02": "Yeah...",
  "PasserByChat6_01": "That's quite...",
  "PasserByChat6_02": "I should keep looking...",
  "PasserByChat7_01": "That's it...",
  "PasserByChat7_02": "That'll do in a pinch...",
  "PasserByChat8_01": "Found it...",
  "PasserByChat8_02": "Where have I seen that before...",
  "PasserByChat9_01": "I really wanna watch this...",
  "PasserByChat9_02": "Same! I wanna watch it too...",
  "PasserByChat10_01": "Who borrowed this one...",
  "PasserByChat10_02": "What should we do...",
  "PasserByChat11_01": "This one's great!",
  "PasserByChat11_02": "I've never seen that...",
  "PasserByChat12_01": "Yeah...",
  "PasserByChat12_02": "How about this one...",
  "PasserByChat13_01": "I've seen that one...",
  "PasserByChat13_02": "Let's watch it again...",
  "PasserByChat14_01": "Whoa, there's heaps of cult stuff here!",
  "PasserByChat14_02": "Way better than going to the movies!",
  "PasserByChat15_01": "This ramen shop looks great.",
  "PasserByChat15_02": "I can smell it from here. I'm already starting to feel full!",
  "PasserByChat15_03": "Good. I'll have my bowl first then, and you can watch.",
  "PasserByChat16_01": "Wanna play a round of Starlight Legend ∑? The loser has to buy dinner!",
  "PasserByChat16_02": "This version sucks! I played it before and all the characters have been nerfed hard!",
  "PasserByChat16_03": "I thought you loved playing this version?",
  "PasserByChat17_01": "Ah! His new guitar album hit my soul with a twang!",
  "PasserByChat17_02": "Do you have a speaker inside your skull?",
  "PasserByChat18_01": "I wish I had a car, then I could go wherever I want on weekends.",
  "PasserByChat18_02": "Like... a day trip to old town?",
  "PasserByChat18_03": "Hey, nobody wants a trip to hell, right?",
  "PasserByChat19_01": "He's always trying to get me to watch horror movies with him.",
  "PasserByChat19_02": "Who does he take me for? One of those screamer types who plays all dumb and weak?",
  "PasserByChat19_03": "Have you ever considered... that perhaps he might not dare to watch them alone?",
  "PasserByChat20_01": "You can sell coffee for higher prices if you dress up like a maid.",
  "PasserByChat20_02": "So... if I dress up as a maid, I can make some extra cash?",
  "PasserByChat20_03": "Then your boss will dress up as a maid, and clean up all your extra salary.",
  "PasserByChat21_01": "Huh? Why has the vending machine from here gone?",
  "PasserByChat21_02": "People stopped using it because things kept getting stuck inside.",
  "PasserByChat21_03": "What a shame! I used to come kick this thing every day and a can of Barbecue Shot would fall out...",
  "PasserByChat21_04": "So the reason the machine broke... is you?",
  "PasserByChat22_01": "There have been lots of disasters with the Hollows these days. Other districts aren't safe.",
  "PasserByChat22_02": "I wonder if the rent here will go up... Sigh, I wish for world peace.",
  "PasserByChat22_03": "Peace has nothing to do with it! It all depends on a kind-hearted landlord.",
  "PasserByChat22_04": "That's even rarer than \"world peace\"...",
  "PasserByChat23_01": "Last time! I'll definitely draw a secret Bangboo doll this time!",
  "PasserByChat23_02": "Hmm... well, you gotta believe in something.",
  "PasserByChat24_01": "Are you telling me that if I load up some candy into this soda, it'll explode like a volcano?",
  "PasserByChat24_02": "What do you think of this brilliant idea of mine?",
  "PasserByChat24_03": "I think I'd better stay far away from you.",
  "PasserByChat25_01": "If I scream at my idol's concert, will they notice me?",
  "PasserByChat25_02": "Security will notice you first.",
  "PasserByChat26_01": "Did you watch the latest episode of Hollow Zoo last night?",
  "PasserByChat26_02": "They said there are larger and more violent leaders among the Ethereals.",
  "PasserByChat26_03": "Sounds just like my boss.",
  "PasserByChat27_01": "I played A Shepherd's Story all day on my day off. Watching cows out to pasture was really soothing.",
  "PasserByChat27_02": "Do you like animals?",
  "PasserByChat27_03": "I like beef hot pot.",
  "PasserByChat28_01": "This week's homework is so hard... I can't wait to start working instead.",
  "PasserByChat28_02": "At the very least, I can look after myself and earn a bit of coin!",
  "PasserByChat28_03": "No, you're actually just earning money for your landlord.",
  "PasserByChat29_01": "What does it feel like to work and bring home a salary?",
  "PasserByChat29_02": "It feels like... I was happier back when I was a student.",
  "PasserByChat29_03": "Ugh... why does everyone say that?",
  "PasserByChat30_01": "You've put on some weight... Maybe you should try a diet?",
  "PasserByChat30_02": "It's healthier to have some fat where you're supposed to!",
  "PasserByChat30_03": "But I got this fat by drinking cans of Barbecue Shot...",
  "PasserByChat31_01": "Hey, how do you choose your own fashion style?",
  "PasserByChat31_02": "When you find a style that's cute just copy it.",
  "PasserByChat31_03": "But I think Bangboo are the cutest...",
  "PasserByChat32_01": "Working so much overtime and drinking so much Orange God... that's no good for the skin.",
  "PasserByChat33_01": "Starlight Knight badges? Oh, my dear spending money...",
  "PasserByChat34_01": "Invite her out for some barbecue... No! She deserves something more creative!",
  "PasserByChat35_01": "Imperial baked cream cookies... mmm, a treat for working overtime.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_15_name": "Belle",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_name": "Billy",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_name": "Anby",

  "SideChat_Chapter1_02_03": "Ehn-ne ne-nu-nah ne!\n(The manager said everything's cool! We can trust them.)",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_09_01": "Ehn-ne-ne ehn-ne! \n(Someone who can help is here!)",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_09_02": "Nhe-uhn!\n(They're fine, despite looking a little thin and weak.)",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_09_03": "Ne-nu nu-nhe na!\n(The boss says we can trust them!)",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_09_09": "They're cursing us out?",
  "PasserByChat47_01": "The new cookie flavors are great. If only they were low sugar.",
  "chat21_02": "Thank you for taking the commission. I've heard about the details from Anby.",
  "chat21_03": "Just leave data retrieval for the flash drive to me.",
  "chat21_06": "We're in this business to help people too, right?",
  "chat21_07": "The customers this time are all old friends from the Sixth Street: old Enzo from the remodeling shop and Schwarz from the convenience store — or at least, their Bangboos.",
  "chat26_02": "Nicole just told me they've found some clues about where the strongbox is.",
  "chat26_03": "They're rushing over right now.",
  "chat26_04": "Looks like my commission is about to be signed.",
  "chat26_05": "Ah yes. — I've already retrieved data from the damaged disk, by the way.",
  "chat26_06": "The H.D.D. system is running final deciphers now. It's super-encrypted, so I borrowed some processing power from the Proxy Network.",
  "chat26_07": "Data may be stored in a rented data cloud.",
  "chat26_08": "We'll give the key info to them as soon as Nicole pays her debt.",
  "chat26_09": "The meeting spot is still in the garage. I'll ‘warm up’ the H.D.D. system for you.",
  "chat26_10": "Over to you then.",

  "Chat_Chapter0_03_name": "Elfy",
  "Chat_Chapter0_04_name": "General Chop",
  "Chat_Chapter0_04_07": "The ingredients are no big deal, and I've already bought some back-up stuff elsewhere. It's just...",
  "Chat_Chapter0_04_08": "I hope nothing happens to that poor courier. I don't even know his name, but he's my regular guy and I feel responsible for him...",
  "Chat_Chapter0_04_09": "I'm shutting up the ramen shop until I hear he's safe.\nI can't cook while I'm worried sick like this!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_05_name": "General Chop",
  "Chat_Chapter0_05_06": "Actually, I got a call from Pegasus Logistics just after you took on the commission saying that the courier had thankfully escaped the Hollow.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_05_07": "That's right — my ingredients may have been ruined, but I saw on the Proxy Network that you guys saved all of 141's stuff! What a pleasant surprise.",
  "Chat_Chapter0_05_08": "The courier is fine, and I passed on all the stuff to those three guys at the convenience store. Now I can get back to my cooking — with gusto!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_05_09": "Are you feeling hungry, {NICKNAME}? You're my first lucky customer since I re-opened the shop!",
  "Chat_Chapter0_06_name": "Belle",
  "Chat_Chapter0_06_nameF": "Wise",
  "Chat_Chapter00_15_nameF": "Wise",
  "Chat_Chapter00_15_01": "Done already? I'd expect nothing less!",
  "Chat_Chapter00_15_02": "Go tell Elfy and General Chop. They'll be over the moon.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_01": "Huh? If it isn't the manager!",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_02": "What are you doing?",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_03": "What about Nicole?",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_04": "I booked in a complete overhaul for Old Smokey, and they'll clean her up too while they're at it!",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_05": "Most of my recent commissions have involved some pretty hardcore driving, so I have to make sure she's kept in top shape.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_06": "Ever thought of upgrading to a new vehicle?",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_07": "A new car? What are you talking about... Old Smokey's part of the family! She's guided us through many a life-or-death situation. How could we just replace her!",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_08": "And besides, she's in her golden years now with limitless potential. She ain't past her use-by date, no way!",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_09": "My mistake.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_10": "Oh yeah — Nicole went to get in touch with her contacts at the Hollow Investigative Association.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_11": "Her acquaintance will help find a way to isolate the location of the strongbox inside the Hollow. We'll regroup once everything has been confirmed.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_12": "So looks like we'll be leaning on you once more when the time comes. You are Phaethon the legendary Proxy, after all!",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_13": "Don't say that name in public.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_14": "Keep it down!",
  "Chat_Chapter00_16_15": "Oh—oh yeah... I forgot. Sorry!",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_01": "Nicole asked me to buy some supplies for the next commission.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_02": "What did you buy?",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_03": "Then I won't bother you.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_04": "A gallon of Bomb Cola, a pack of UFO chips and some Ol' Captain Jerky, a supersize bottle of Nitro-Fuel, and some Rocketjump candy...",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_05": "...Maybe you should check with Nicole first.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_06": "Did you get the right shopping list?",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_07": "Hmm? But this shopping list is the one Nicole gave me.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_08": "Celebrative snacks for a successful commission are Cunning Hares tradition.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_09": "Nicole says, \"Following me is the best strategy! You guys just start planning the after-party!\"",
  "Chat_Chapter00_17_10": "I trust her.",
  "Chat_Chapter00_18_nameF": "Wise",
  "Chat_Chapter00_18_01": "Despite the structural damage to Nicole's flash drive, the transfer protocols were thankfully still intact.",

  "SideChat_Chapter1_13_04": "Miss Kerry had to go back and sort out the rest of the orphans, so she left.\nI thought you might be reporting back to her, so I waited here for you.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_13_05": "Miss Kerry told me your friend completed the commission, but that the result was unsatisfactory. Is that right?",

  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_03": "...Let me fill in the details.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_04": "As you left, I picked up a new mission over in the Cretan Hollow. While on duty, I picked up a name badge from a rebel's body that had the orphanage's address on it.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_05": "I called Miss Kerry to confirm, and she identified it as—",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_06": "William!!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_07": "—'s name badge.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_08": "Oh little William! He must be in danger in the Hollow! And aren't the other kids in bad shape, too?! I... wait, what's that noise?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_09": "Ah... sorry about that. It's my work device, one second.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_10": "Do you have to answer that right now?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_11": "Are you on a mission right now?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_12": "It's alright. It's just a notification from the treatment team.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_13": "Huh? Miss, were you... injured?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_14": "It's just a scratch from when I found that name badge. No big deal.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_15": "Helpful citizen, I still have another mission to deal with here. Is your friend able to help take on this commission?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_16": "Of course!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_17": "I'll do it. I mean, my friend will!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_18": "Excellent. Then I'll leave it in your capable hands, helpful...\nHey, what's your name anyway?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_19": "I'm {NICKNAME}.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_20": "Okay, {NICKNAME}. You can call me Soldier 11. \nThis name badge is still in good condition with basically no corruption. Perhaps those lost children are still in the Hollow.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_14_21": "Please! Wonderful Proxy and your amazing friend — I can pay you! Please help my kids!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_15_01": "Ah, it's my wonderful Proxy's amazing friend! I didn't expect to see you again so soon. Your name is... {NICKNAME}, right?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_15_02": "Miss Kerry?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_15_03": "How's William doing?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_15_04": "Speaking of which, please thank your friend for me!\nWilliam has been rescued and after a quick check-up is safely back at the orphanage!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_15_05": "Thank you so very, very much!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_15_06": "As long as the kid's fine, that's all that matters. What are you doing here though?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_15_07": "I'm planning on submitting an official rescue request with the Hollow Investigative Association!\nI've been a mess since the accident, I couldn't do anything useful aside from crying and relying on others.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_15_08": "And I even ended up getting that military girl hurt...\nIt's just unacceptable. She's obviously just a young woman herself...",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_15_09": "I'm going to use my position as the Dean! With William's testimony, we'll persuade the Association to take fast action!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_15_10": "I want to cry. I want to clutch onto the pant legs of those officials and cry my heart out!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_01": "Welcome to my... huh?!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_02": "Soldier 11?! What are you doing at the store?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_03": "Hi there. It's an emergency, so I'll cut to the chase. \nPlease answer truthfully, {NICKNAME}. Your Proxy friend...",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_04": "Are they a professional Proxy? Or are you covering for someone else?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_05": "Why do you ask?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_06": "This commission is top secret and I'll only go over the necessary details — but I still need to confirm that the Proxy undertaking this commission has no connections to any outside organizations.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_07": "That's something I can definitely guarantee.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_08": "Don't worry. My friend is a lone wolf through and through.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_09": "That's good. I posted a new commission called \"Europa.\"\nPlease have your friend to accept it.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_10": "The commission details are intentionally vague. I'll fill you in now, and you pass on the exact details to your friend.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_11": "We're about to launch a suppression campaign on the rebels' hideout, at the highest level.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_12": "If there are any children still in the nearby vicinity, there's no way they'll survive it!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_13": "The combat operation begins in exactly two hours. It's quite urgent.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_14": "Please call your friend to assemble a crack squad to venture into the Hollow and search for those trapped kids.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_15": "Got it!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_16": "I'll contact my friend right away!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_16_17": "Thanks, {NICKNAME}. \nRemember, there's only two hours to go!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_01": "{NICKNAME}, we meet again. I brought Miss Kerry along, and she wants to tell you—",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_02": "Thank you thank you thank you!! The kids are all back, all safe and in one piece!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_03": "That's right! The Association's rescue team followed up with me just recently.\nDespite not being the rescuers themselves, their testimony helped our orphanage secure funding investment from the Association!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_04": "I'd like to thank your friend, too.\nYour good deeds far outweigh any monetary reward possible, so you can be proud of yourselves.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_05": "Hey, I heard you're the owner of that Random Play video store, is that true?\nOnce the kids have all settled down, I'll definitely be paying you a visit!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_06": "When the time comes, could you please find something warm and fuzzy for us? I'll take it back to the orphanage and watch it together with the kids!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_07": "Sure thing, Miss, any time!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_08": "Alright, I've got to get back and face the music.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_09": "Face the music?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_10": "It may have been an emergency, but I was still forced to break a few rules.\nI can't keep hiding things forever, so I'm heading back to confess and face my punishment.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_11": "How can that be, though? You were the one who helped me, who helped my kids...\nI'll go with you as proof. Your boss has to come around!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_12": "No. I acted alone, and I will take full responsibility.\nAnd the discipline, it's just a hundred laps around the base or taking out 100 low-level Ethereal from in the Hollows. No big deal.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_13": "But you saved all those kids. You're our patron now! And you're still going to get disciplined...\nThat's so unfair... Oh, boohoohoo!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_14": "Hang on. Don't cry just because of me, Miss Kerry.\nThe kids are all safe. You should be happy...",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_15": "(Don't recommend a warm and fuzzy movie, lest she starts crying again.)",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_17_16": "(Perhaps we should recommend some funny movies instead...)",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_01": "Yo, you're back! My old friend.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_02": "We're really not that close.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_03": "We just met via a commission.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_04": "Don't be like that! How about a cup of coffee? It might only be 141 instant coffee, but the second cup is half price, you can take one for your sister.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_05": "Okay, okay. Don't look at me like that. Seriously though, given that you're here... that piece about Phaethon being arrested must be fake news.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_06": "How cruel, switching accounts like that without telling me~ But I can tell just from looking at you that there's more to it than that.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_07": "Long story short, it's complicated...",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_08": "Whoa, slow down! Please don't tell me what it was that made the mighty Phaethon go through all that. I don't have the nerves for it.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_09": "I'm just a simple and innocent commission middleman: I just pass on commissions to others and take a cut.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_10": "Perhaps it would be better if nobody took any cut.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_11": "Doing my own commissions is good enough for me.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_12": "Don't be like that! You know how fierce the competition in this line of work is! Some people even team up to monopolize all the high-value commissions.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_13": "You don't want to waste all your time landing lousy commissions, right? Only an old friend like me can help balance the supply with the demand.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_18_14": "How about this, then? I've got a great commission for you lined up right now. Super easy, but decent pay.\nTreat it as a gift to celebrate your rebirth! Waddaya say?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_01": "Yo, you're back! My old friend.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_02": "We're really not that close.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_03": "We just met via a commission.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_04": "Don't be like that! How about a cup of coffee? It might only be 141 instant coffee, but the second cup is half price, you can take one for your brother.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_05": "Okay, okay. Don't stare at me like that! Seriously though, given that you're here... I heard about Phaethon being arrested, that freaked me out.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_06": "Switching accounts without telling me like that... our chat logs haven't been saved to their database, right?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_07": "Don't worry. Everything's been deleted.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_08": "Whew~ that's great. Then we can keep working together with peace of mind. I'll grab high-value commissions and pass them on to you, just like before.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_09": "I've changed my mind. I'll be taking on my own commissions now.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_10": "I've changed my mind. I don't need a middleman anymore.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_11": "Don't be like that! You know how fierce the competition in this line of work is! Some people even team up to monopolize all the high-value commissions.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_12": "If it weren't for a loner like me scoring them all, then all those great jobs would've been snatched up by other Proxies. There'd just be all these thankless jobs working for penny-pinching commissions on your Proxy Network.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_19_13": "How about this, then? I've got a great commission for you lined up right now. Super easy, but decent pay.\nTreat it as a gift to rekindle our cooperation! Waddaya say?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_20_01": "Yo, you're back! I've got a great commission for you.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_20_02": "You also rake in a nice cut from it.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_20_03": "Sigh, don't worry about that. Your results are so reassuring for this client that they can sleep for days.\nNobody wants to wake up early in the morning, throw open the curtains, and see Ethereals lounging around on the balcony, right?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_20_04": "The client's happy, and so are you.\nYou know how the saying goes: \"Only the best commission will do for the best Proxy.\"",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_20_05": "It's a pleasure working with my favorite Proxy! I'll come find you next time the coffee is on sale.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_21_01": "Oh, you're back. Two hours and twenty minutes earlier than expected. Looks like our close business relationship is starting to take shape~",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_21_02": "...Do your job.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_21_03": "Alright, alright~ That last client loved you. She posted online about how this Proxy is more reliable than the Association.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_21_04": "Thanks to her, the number of commissions up on the Proxy Network has exploded. So how about another juicy job, eh?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_21_05": "The Association released a massive kill list not long ago of all the Ethereals, from which all official Investigators can select targets to annihilate.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_21_06": "That's how this commission came up. There're always some peace-loving hippy Investigators who can't do it themselves.\nThey just post up a high bounty anonymously on the Proxy Network, and let Proxies venture into Hollows as their agents.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_21_07": "The rest of the details are in the commission. Let's make some bank. Want a cup of joe for the road? It's 141 instant coffee though...",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_22_01": "Ah, it's you. Good job on that commission, it's done.\nWhat kind of coffee do you want? Once the cafe opens, it's on me.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_22_02": "Even though all the credit will no doubt go to the Association, the end result is the same, we've got one fewer threat in this town.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_22_03": "As long as the money's good, there's nothing wrong with being a hero from behind-the-scenes. Am I right?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_26_01": "Hey there, I'm just dropping off a videotape.\nIt might not have been much use, but my son watched the whole thing while dozing off.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_26_02": "But that Proxy's short movie, he was glued speechless to it!\nAnd while I couldn't make out any initial reaction, I trust he was suitably shocked!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_26_03": "It's the least I can do.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_26_04": "Can a short movie alone really change this kid's mind...?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_26_05": "I trust he'll never talk about any Hollow with me ever again!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_27_01": "Alright — this one! I'll show dad what Hollows are really like!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_27_02": "Are you borrowing this for your father?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_27_03": "Your goal is to one day go adventuring into Hollows?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_27_04": "Yeah! Dad just keeps yapping on about all the dangers and risks there, saying there's nothing in there but disaster. That can't be true!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_27_05": "What's even more irritating is that he got a Proxy to shoot some footage to show me.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_27_06": "But with just one glance at it, I could tell that he was deliberating hunting out an Ethereal just to try and freak me out!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_27_07": "Hmph, I'm going to fight back with these tapes...\nHmm, no... he'll definitely say that it's all actors using special effects. That his movie is better.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_27_08": "It's OK!\nI put up a commission on the Proxy Network and will score some real footage soon. I can't wait to see his face then!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_28_01": "Why not?!\nWhy can't I be an intern with the Hollow Investigative Association?",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_28_02": "Of course you can't! How old are you? You have to finish school, not run off to die in those damned Hollows!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_28_03": "Hollows aren't that dangerous! New Eridu depends on us utilizing Ether! Didn't I show you that short movie? That's real footage shot by a pro inside a Hollow!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_28_04": "There's no way you can trust some random Proxy's footage! Didn't I show you that short movie, too? That's what it really looks like in a Hollow!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_28_05": "That Proxy nobody's footage is even worse. It's obvious they're just causing trouble with the Ethereal!",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_28_06": "...Ahem.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_28_07": "Please don't argue outside my store.",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_28_08": "Ahh... Sorry about that. I lost my temper. This brat just won't listen...",
  "SideChat_Chapter1_28_09": "Same here. Sorry. I came to return this tape, but bumped into dad here at the store... Now we've ended up fighting over Hollows, as usual...",

  "Galgame_Chapter0_05_18": "Thanks for the explanation...\nSo here's the question. What exactly is the wall in front of us?",

  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_12": "Hey, talking like that isn't good for business, you know? The commission isn't over until we get back that strongbox!",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_13": "According to what we witnessed before extraction, the strongbox should be in the territory of an active superior Ethereal.",

  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_15": "The White Star Institution has it registered as Dullahan, a superior level Ethereal.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_16": "That's the one! That Red Fang Gang dude is unlucky, being mutated by the Ether into such a dangerous Ethereal.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_17": "Me and Anby tried to grab the strongbox, but that guy is so strong! We didn't get the chance before we got extracted. We did find this along the way though.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_18": "That's quite fine jewelry, but it isn't enough to cover the debt?",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_19": "A tooth necklace? For me? I love it!",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_20": "No, it's actually a small storage device. It belonged to that Red Fang Gang guy before he became an Ethereal.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_21": "It was left at the scene while fighting that Dullahan guy.\nBilly picked it up just before {NICKNAME} extracted us.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_22": "If that guy was wearing it, then it must have something important on it!",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_23": "I bet it's to do with the strongbox!",

  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_26": "{NICKNAME}, can you do something with it using that complicated computer of yours?",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_27": "If it's just getting the data out, I can give it a try.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_28": "For a price of course.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_29": "Great! Then it's a deal! We'll go look into the location of the strongbox and come find you when we learn something.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_06_30": "Let's just go our separate ways until we contact you about recovering the strongbox. Don't forget to export the data from the flash drive!",

  "Galgame_Chapter0_19_49F": "It seemed to be having some kind of overload, it was sparking and flashing like a concert at 404.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_19_50F": "We thought the extraction plan had failed, but then the Bangboo suddenly started to move, and it took Nicole and everyone to the exit.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_19_51F": "{NICKNAME}, you were out cold for the whole process, twitching and mumbling.",

  "Galgame_Chapter0_19_60F": "Then let me tell you the bad news.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_19_61F": "You remember I said I have no choice but to believe you? The chip is read directly by the Bangboo, which is connected to the H.D.D. system...",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_19_62F": "Go take a look at the computer, but be prepared.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_23_06F": "I didn't install this! Before you blacked out, the H.D.D. System restarted. That's when she appeared.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_23_09F": "It'll be faster if I show you. Brace yourself.",
  "Galgame_Chapter0_23_11F": "Ahem. Fairy? Are you there?",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_01_20": "From your perspective, there's still a lot of residents... Can the Vision Corporation really evacuate them all before construction starts?",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_09": "Just two others— They're behind you!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_10": "Hmph, that's one down~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_11": "Good teamwork. Billy, do you really have a cold?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_12": "Oh, the machine oil I'm using now has low fluidity in the cold, so some of my gears are starting to run slow...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_13": "I think you were wearing too little last night while watching \"Oh~ Sweetheart.\"",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_14": "Wear more next time. It's getting cold, and Nicole refuses to turn the heating on.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_15": "It's still way off from needing to turn the heating on... A-ACHOO—!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_16": "Who's there?!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_17": "Uh-oh, Nicole's sneeze was too loud. Someone over there heard...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_18": "Nicole's sneeze has drawn a crowd. Nicole, awaiting orders.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_19": "...Stop talking about me sneezing! Spread them out, fight as you run!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_03_20": "We'll meet back at base... First person to arrive can have their room heated tonight!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_01": "Feline demi-humans have a slightly higher body temperature than humans.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_02": "Guided by the pull of a warm hand, Nicole finally escaped the maze-like streets.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_03": "Boss!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_04": "Nicole, are you OK?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_05": "What are you doing here! Didn't we agree to meet back at base?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_06": "We were worried about you.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_07": "We couldn't stop worrying... Oh, and this little kitten is?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_08": "My new friend—",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_09": "Name's Nekomata~ Your new client!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_10": "Oh? That's Nicole for you! Finding work at a time like this... My role model!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_11": "Did you approach Nicole yourself?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_12": "Don't worry, Anby. If it weren't for Nekomata, I'd still be trapped in the Red Fang Gang's hideout.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_13": "Yeah, don't be nervous. I'm on your side~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_14": "...There's something I need to get back from the Red Fang Gang.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_15": "Several years ago the Red Fang Gang's leader Miguel \"Silver\" took a relic of my family. I infiltrated their territory to get it back, but I've yet to be successful.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_16": "Until a few months ago, when I heard the brave Cunning Hares had tricked Silver into a Hollow and defeated him, leaving the Red Fangs leaderless...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_17": "Tricked and defeated...? Did we do something that awesome? Hahaha...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_18": "Don't be an idiot in front of the client. —So you want us to take advantage of the current chaos within the gang and get back your family's relic?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_19": "Hmm, that could be tricky.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_20": "We're already in trouble with the Red Fang Gang. There've been some unavoidable confrontations. Any further trouble will just make things worse. As the saying goes, harmony breeds wealth...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_21": "That relic is really valuable~! I'm willing to pay 30% of its value as a bonus! Depending on the situation, perhaps even 70%!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_22": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_23": "Just how much is it worth?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_24": "—Nicole. Can I say something?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_25": "Considering how dangerous the job is, I think it'd be better to confirm the sincerity of the client rather than the fee.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_26": "I'm more sincere than when there's an unlimited mackerel buffet!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_27": "Really? ...But in movies, new companions appearing around the main character at times like this are always being deceitful.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_28": "Later on, she might turn into a scary ghost, or a monster will spring out from within her body.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_29": "There's no monster inside me! Do...do you want to touch and see?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_30": "No thanks.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_31": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_32": "Is there a Red Fang Gang hideout nearby?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_33": "There is... Why?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_34": "Good. Let's go there and start searching.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_35": "Just you and me.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_36": "While we search for the relic, you'll have a chance to prove you're an enemy of the Red Fang Gang.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_37": "You're annoying. I'd rather go with Nicole~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_38": "Please don't misunderstand. I'm the one whose trust you need to earn.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_39": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_04_40": "...I never thought Anby was the kind of person to be hated by cats...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_01": "You're back. Did you find it?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_02": "We didn't, but I took out a bunch of Red Fang guys! I'm working hard! Please scratch under my chin~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_03": "Billy, you do it. Anby, are you satisfied that Nekomata is sincere now?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_04": "...She did do well, but...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_05": "OK Nekomata. On behalf of the Cunning Hares, I accept your commission!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_06": "I need a ten percent deposit. That's the rules.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_07": "No problem! Let me see what's in my purse~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_08": "That's MY purse! You stole it while we were fighting...?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_09": "That's cuz fighting with you is just so BORING.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_10": "Hm? How odd~ Why does your purse have a picture of Nicole?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_11": "That's a group photo. Give it back or I'll...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_12": "OK OK, Anby put the blade down, Nekomata give the purse back!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_13": "We'll leave the deposit for later. You've got information on the Red Fang Gang, so you can follow us for now, OK?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_14": "Sure! I want to get back my family's relic as soon as possible.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_15": "Wait a sec, I have to go home and lock the door. Three minutes!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_16": "Nekomata disappears into the alley. A few moments later, Anby speaks cautiously—",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_17": "Nicole, is this really OK?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_18": "There's something... familiar about the way she fights. She's got skills only someone involved with the gangs would have. ",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_19": "But you're the one who makes all the decisions. I'll carry out your orders without question.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_20": "Anby, I understand how you feel... \"I was here first\" or whatever... ",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_21": "I don't know what you're talking about.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_22": "I don't know what you're talking about. —But there's nothing to lose, right?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_23": "Even if the little kitten has any bad ideas, nothing gets past me. And the Red Fang Gang keeps getting in the way, it's time to try something different.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_24": "Don't forget we have a mission— We have to help \"Phaethon\" find out about the strongbox and that hacker.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_25": "No matter what Nekomata and the Red Fang Gang have going on, this is a chance to find out about the strongbox, not to mention a substantial commission payment. Why shouldn't we do it?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_26": "Nicole has thought of everything.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_27": "I'm back~ Did I miss anything?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_28": "Absolutely nothing. To celebrate the Cunning Hare's new commission, dinner tonight is on Billy!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_29": "Yay! Dinner's on Ni— Wait! Why me?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_30": "Eh? Who was it who said last time they want to treat everyone to a big meal at the Starlight Knight-themed restaurant~?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_31": "If there's one thing that can be trusted, it's Nicole's memory.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_32": "OK, OK... Just promise me one thing!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_33": "Allow me to refuse.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_34": "Work with me Anby! I told you the condition to treating you last time, right?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_35": "We have to do a group photo of us all doing the Starlight Knight flying kick!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_36": "...The four of us? You mean me too?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_37": "Hehe, of course. You're our important client.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_38": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_05_39": "Hmph, be prepared Billy... I'm gonna eat back the entire bonus I gave you last month! ",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_01": "Hm? Is this really a Red Fang Gang hideout...?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_02": "We didn't take a wrong turn did we? Why is no one here?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_03": "There's something burnt on the floor.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_04": "Looks like some kind of book... No, a ledger.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_05": "They threw away something so confidential? Did the Red Fang Gang abandon this hideout?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_06": "Without their leader they don't even have the strength to maintain the hideout... Nicole?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_07": "What?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_08": "You have to be careful.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_09": "D-don't mislead people! I'm an upstanding citizen and the Cunning Hares are a law-abiding company! We won't end up like that \"Silver\" guy!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_10": "Nicole is arguing with shadows...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_11": "Enough chit-chat. Nekomata, where was the next hideout?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_12": "Hmm...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_13": "Nekomata? Are you with us?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_14": "...! Hehe, sorry, I was a little distracted~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_15": "Let's go! The next one is deeper within the Hollow.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_06_16": "How are you still so happy...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_07_01": "Ahhh! Found it!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_07_02": "Found what? My family's relic?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_07_03": "Maybe!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_07_04": "...!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_07_05": "If your family's relic is this shiny, most awesome Starlight Knight emblem of the last ten years... Ouch-ouch-ouch-ouch!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_07_06": "Consider that from Nekomata~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_07_07": "Your skin is so hard, my hand hurts... Wear a sweater next time! The kind your mom would knit you to stay warm!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_07_08": "If he's wearing a thick sweater, it wouldn't hurt him.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_07_09": "Good point! No sweater!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_07_10": "...Hmph. Am I supposed to thank Anby?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_01": "In the name of Starlight, justice will be served—!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_02": "Hyaa! ...Huh? Nobody's home.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_03": "Dang, nobody saw me looking cool!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_04": "Oh yeah, according to the info, the Red Fang Gang hideout should be empty... That's why Nicole sent me to check it out...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_05": "What's that? Are there people over there...?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_06": "What are they saying? This knight's gonna have a little listen!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_07": "They say this hideout's head guy has run, leaving behind a mess.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_08": "Before leaving he said \"I can't believe the state of this gang, it wasn't like this years ago.\"",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_09": "And \"Had I known earlier, I'd have gone with the old leaders...\"",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_10": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_11": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_12": "Billy? The intel?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_13": "Ah? That was the intel.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_14": "...Who wants to listen to a Red Fang Gang sob story? I asked for intel on Nekomata's family and the relic!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_15": "Didn't they say anything about where they put all the valuable stuff?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_16": "Oh, oh... Yeah! It's in a small storehouse, just over there!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_08_17": "You just have to go through a Companion Hollow!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_01": "That's it then. We can start looking for Nekomata's relic.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_02": "It's not my relic! It's my family's relic!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_03": "You're good at bringing the conversation back to yourself. I have no interest in your family.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_04": "And it doesn't look like there's much worth searching for here.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_05": "That's true, the place has been emptied. Did the Red Fang Gang abandon this place too...?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_06": "We've been coming up empty for days. Nekomata, does your family's relic really exist?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_07": "Of course it does~ I'm not afraid of being alone like you, sleeping with imaginary friends every night~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_08": "I don't do such a thing.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_09": "Holding someone is an ineffective way to sleep. Side by side gives better results.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_10": "You're only gonna dispute the sleeping position?!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_11": "Hold it. There's one last Red Fang Gang hideout in the area right? Let's go check it out tomorrow.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_12": "What if we don't find it? If we keep wasting time on this are we still gonna be able to get paid this month...?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_13": "Of course!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_14": "...As long as the market stabilizes!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_09_15": "Boss! Don't use our salaries on the stock market!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_01": "We've searched the entire hideout. It isn't here.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_02": "What are we even looking for?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_03": "What?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_04": "Your family relic. Up until now you've said you'll tell us if you see it. If you just told us what it was...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_05": "You wanna know? Chase your tail round 100 times and I'll tell you!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_06": "I don't have a tail! I don't mind fighting to clear these hideouts, but isn't your family relic important to you? Don't you wanna find it faster?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_07": "Yeah~ If it was another odd-job agency they could help... But the Cunning Hares...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_08": "I can't pretend I didn't hear that! You doubt the Cunning Hares ability?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_09": "Oh no, I don't doubt your ability at all. It's because I believe in you that I decided to divide the labor!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_10": "What's that supposed to mean?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_11": "I checked your reputation on public forums carefully. As long as you're paid enough, there's no commission you can't solve. You're always in the top 10!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_12": "Haha! Right on point!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_13": "But you're also in the top three for complaints.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_14": "Why?!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_15": "The first 50 comments all said \"the object has been damaged\", \"overly damaged\", \"they stole the item\", stuff like that. Look, they even attached a photo!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_16": "Can't argue with that.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_17": "Can't argue with that.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_18": "We're looking for something very important to me, so there can't be any mistakes. So to be safe, just leave the searching to me.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_19": "Hmmm... O-OK, I can accept that. So? Are there any hideouts we haven't searched yet?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_20": "Let me think... I don't really remember the last one. Perhaps if Nicole held me in her bosom~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_21": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_22": "What are you mumbling about? You want my face to melt on her bosom?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_23": "...No. I was just saying, watch your back...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_10_24": "—!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_01": "Phew... Nekomata, what you said before...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_02": "I said I prefer Nicole~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_03": "Not that... You said there's still the last hideout.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_04": "Oh that. I'm afraid you guys might struggle with that place...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_05": "Nice try! Though I do kinda wanna prove you wrong!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_06": "Hmph, for the right price, there's nothing the Cunning Hares can't handle~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_07": "Really? Even if you have to go through the Dead End Hollow to the edges of the old capital? You may run into some dangerous Ethereals...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_08": "The Dead End Hollow? The one near the old capital?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_09": "You know it?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_10": "I've heard Investigators talking about it. They said a \"notorious\" Ethereal hangs out around there, so dangerous it's on the wanted list. Nobody has been able to take it out.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_11": "The Red Fang Gang hideout is hidden next to something so dangerous?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_12": "It's convenient. Just like feral cats that choose places dangerous to humans to avoid being caught. It takes a lot of effort to find these secret little nests!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_13": "Secret little nests... Isn't it hard getting into such heavily guarded places?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_14": "No, there shouldn't be many people.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_15": "Why?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_16": "The TV said that it's at the Old Capital Metro construction site, which has been surrounded by the Vision Corporation to be demolished. It's already been cleared of all personnel.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_17": "If the TV said it, it must be true.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_11_18": "I envy you Anby, you'll believe anything...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_01": "The computer displays the data analyzed by Nicole's Bangboo.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_02": "The sound of the news on the TV suddenly grabs their attention—",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_03": "Welcome back. We're coming to you live— The Vision Corporation's last train is about to enter the Dead End Hollow.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_04": "Reports say this is the last of the industrial Ether explosives to be used for the demolition, which will begin as soon as it reaches the target location.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_05": "Oh no! The last train just went in! Nicole and the others are still in there!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_06": "We can't keep watching. We have to find a way to stop that train from entering the construction zone! Or Nicole is gonna be blown to bits!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_07": "Stopping a train in full view of the public? We'd only end up getting arrested. We can only contact Vision to negotiate...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_08": "Stop it? With just the few of us, we'd get caught by Public Security for sure! Hmm... We'll just have to tell Vision what's going on, then...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_09": "No! We can stop the train inside the Hollow!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_10": "Meow! The outside world can't see what's going on inside! That works!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_11": "It would be possible to catch up if we jumped straight into the Dead End Hollow, but we don't have a real-time location of the train. Unless, Fairy...?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_12": "Going straight into the Hollow? We might be able to catch it if we had its location, but how would we... Ah! Fairy!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_13": "Affirmative. Calculating a safe route to the target.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_14": "We have a plan to stop the train! Nekomata, take this Bangboo to the Dead End Hollow and wait for my instructions!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_12_15": "We've figured out a way! Take this Bangboo to the Dead End Hollow! I'll explain the rest when you get there!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_01": "Can you hear me? We're at the other entrance to the Dead End Hollow. Normal access to the construction area is controlled by the Vision Corporation, we'll have to go in from here to find the train.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_02": "Come in, can you hear me? We're at the other entrance to the Dead End Hollow. Normal access to the construction area is controlled by the Vision Corporation, we'll have to go in from here to find the train.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_03": "Time is short. We have to make sure we follow the right path inside the Hollow, we can't afford to get lost.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_04": "Time is short. We have to make sure we follow the right path inside the Hollow, we can't afford to get lost.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_05": "Amazing... You're the first Proxy I've met who acts as a guide in the actual Hollow. No wonder Nicole says you're the best in New Eridu.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_06": "Ah, and don't worry about me getting lost. The Carrot data I bought from another Proxy when working with Nicole and the others still works, so if something goes wrong I can save myself. We have to focus on finding the train!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_07": "You're also an important client, I won't leave you stranded.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_08": "We won't leave you behind no matter how serious things get.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_09": "...Right... Thank you...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_10": "OK! Let's go over the plan!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_11": "We follow the tracks. When the Vision Corporation train slows down, we enter the driver's carriage and stop the train.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_12": "We follow the tracks. When the Vision Corporation train slows down, we enter the driver's carriage and stop the train.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_13": "The explosives train should follow the safe route established by the Investigative Association. We just have to get into the driver's carriage to stop it. We'll have to avoid a few accompanying technicians of course.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_14": "The explosives train should follow the safe route established by the Investigative Association. We just have to avoid a few accompanying technicians and sneak into the driver's carriage to stop it.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_15": "—Then we'll use the opportunity to get out of the Hollow and meet up with Nicole! I'm gonna save Nicole again, while Anby can only watch~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_16": "I don't know what this has to do with Anby... But I have to warn you.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_23_17": "I don't know what this has to do with Anby... But I have to warn you.",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_04": "Hmm... There's been no deviation from my predicted route.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_05": "Fia...! Ahem, there's no problem with the route.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_06": "Then it must be this train carriage that's gone the wrong way?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_07": "W-well... about that...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_08": "Meow!? It speaks? A train carriage that can speak — with a gorgeous lady voice, too.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_09": "Huh?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_10": "Excuse me, Ms. Train! We're in a rush here. Could you please shift aside and let us scooch past?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_11": "I-I'm sorry, but I can't do that...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_12": "Enough joking around. There's someone blocking the other side.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_13": "Stop playing around, Nekomata — it's just someone on the other side talking.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_14": "Excuse me... are you Investigators from the Hollow Investigative Association?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_15": "Please report your name and department before asking someone else's identity.",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_17": "Huh? I-is that right? Sorry, I didn't know the custom.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_18": "Um... My name's Corin, from Victoria Housekeeping Co. I'm 16, a Gemini; Rh-negative blood type; I like cleaning, my social number is...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_19": "Hang on, that's enough! Did you want something?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_20": "Stop! That's enough info! Did you want something?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_21": "Th-there was an Ethereal nearby. I got separated from my companions while hiding from it.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_22": "I don't have any Carrot data here... If you're Investigators, then you'll know the way out of here, right? C-can I go out together with you guys?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_23": "So it's just an ordinary person, lost in the Hollow. But what the heck's a maid doing lost somewhere so dangerous? What do you think, {NICKNAME}? Should we help her? Meow!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_24": "I want to help, but it would take three times longer than planned to reach her and take her out. And Nicole and the others...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_25": "I would love to help her, but taking the time to escort her to safety is way outside my original plan. If only Nicole and the others...",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_34": "There's a screeching metallic whine as the center of the abandoned carriage slowly gives off a radiating heat.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_35": "Within seconds, a shockingly large chainsaw spins clean through the carriage as though it were tofu, sending sparks flying everywhere.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_36": "Hey! Ah good, my apron is fine...\nAhh...!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_37": "N-n-nice to meet you, Investigator! I drilled through!",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_39": "You're not just some normal person!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_40": "Sorry... We work in many different fields, including the Hollow services...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_41": "Oh right! You're in a hurry too, right? I can help! As long as you take me out of this Hollow... please!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_42": "A maid who can cut through a train carriage with a chainsaw... You make the call, {NICKNAME}.",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_45": "Can I get a couple of VIP membership cards from your company after?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_46": "I can go with you? Awesome! Thank you! I promise I'll work hard!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_47": "Alright, we can travel together, but we've both got our own secrets, OK? So no idle chit-chat along the way. We'll take you to the nearest exit, and you take care of any Ethereals or wreckage in the way. OK?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_48": "Hang on! I gotta be upfront, we're just helping each other save some time here. So no idle chit-chat along the way. We'll take you to the nearest exit, and you take care of any Ethereals or wreckage in the way. Got it?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_25_49": "The petite maid nods, timidly but resolutely gripping her chainsaw.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_01": "Warning. Hollow exit detected within 100 feet. The commission for Corin of Victoria Housekeeping Co. has been completed.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_02": "Huh? Phaethon? What did you say?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_03": "It's time to say goodbye, Corin.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_04": "Nothing. I was just saying, our \"guest\" has reached their destination.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_05": "R-really? You found an exit? Great...!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_06": "Th-thank you... so much! Without your help, I'd be lost in this Hollow forever!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_07": "You did pretty good yourself. Thanks to your chainsaw, we really 'cut' through a lot of time there.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_08": "It's no big deal. We really saved a load of time there thanks to your chainsaw!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_09": "I-it's my first time meeting a real-life Bangboo Hollow Investigator! Can you p-please tell me your names? I'll come back with my companions to thank you later!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_10": "No need. In this line of work, the less detail you know about people, the better. May we meet again, Corin!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_11": "That's alright. We both had something to gain. Perhaps we'll meet again sometime. Good luck, Corin!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_12": "So long, Corin!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_13": "After a simple farewell, the demi-human and Bangboo soon disappeared at the end of the railway tracks.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_14": "Corin bowed solemnly toward the direction in which they left.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_15": "Hmm... did I hear someone say \"Phaethon\"?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_16": "Did they mean... the famous Proxy?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_26_17": "Ah! Oh no, I have to go out and meet up with everyone!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_01": "I'm back!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_02": "I not only beat back our pursuers, but also destroyed the track switch. That should delay them a while...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_03": "I'm glad you're back safe, Nekomata.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_04": "Let's go over what just happened, shall we?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_05": "Wow, such a serious tone... Can't you at least pretend to be a little more caring!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_06": "Seems you know you're only worthy of pretending.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_07": "You're lucky I don't throw you out.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_08": "You claim Nicole and the others are trapped in the Vision Corporation blast area, and have to go through the Dead End Hollow to save them.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_09": "You claim Nicole and the others are trapped in the Vision Corporation blast area, and have to go through the Dead End Hollow to save them.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_10": "I'm telling the truth! I even brought Nicole's Bangboo as proof...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_11": "Perhaps. But on our way we learned from the news that Vision's train was full of explosives and heading into the Dead End Hollow.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_12": "Perhaps. But on our way we learned from the news that Vision's train was full of explosives and heading into the Dead End Hollow.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_13": "So we had to shut down the train to buy time before we could reach Nicole and the others.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_14": "So we had to shut down the train to buy time before we could reach Nicole and the others.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_15": "That was the plan.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_16": "That was the plan. So why is Vision's train filled with gun-toting Public Security soldiers instead of explosives?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_17": "That was the plan. So why is Vision's train filled with gun-toting Public Security soldiers instead of explosives?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_18": "Seems like you saw this coming. That's why you appeared at the right time, allowing my sister to escape.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_19": "Seems like you saw this coming. That's why you appeared at the right time, allowing my brother to escape.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_20": "Hehe, you're welcome...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_21": "Oh yeah, when I was escaping the Hollow, I think I heard that dangerous Ethereal's footsteps!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_22": "It was scary! Luckily, we only ran into soldiers~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_23": "You're trying to change the topic.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_24": "Ahem. Don't interrupt.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_25": "...Meowww.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_26": "We still don't know if this was you being grateful or a trap.",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_28": "You're angry?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_29": "That depends on how you answer.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_30": "I'm not yet, but I might be.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_31": "Didn't the news say the train was carrying explosives? Why would it be carrying Public Security personnel? Is this what you meant about the Vision CEO lying? Exactly how did Nicole and the others get trapped?",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_33": "...What aren't you telling us?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_34": "Is there something you want to confess?",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_36": "If you want support from \"Phaethon\", you'd better tell us what it is you're hiding...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_37": "I'm not hiding anything. I want to save Nicole and the others even more than you do!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_24_38": "...Here, this is my Bangboo. Can't you guys access the visuals? Watch the record for yesterday and you'll understand.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_01": "Zzz...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_02": "...Ahhh...!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_03": "Can someone tell me why I have to get up so early today?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_04": "Nicole had to contact a Proxy with the lowest price... so we have to leave early just in case...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_05": "I was saving the budget! If we have to contact \"Phaethon\" for such a little thing you can forget about your bonus!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_06": "\"Phaethon\" is...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_07": "New Eridu's most dodgy Proxy. But I admit, they're better than most.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_08": "But their quote for the Dead End Hollow is higher than the industry standard by a half... They've got it in for me!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_09": "But we were met with a wave of Ethereals as soon as we got in the Hollow— Perhaps there's a reason why \"Phaethon\" is wary of the Dead End Hollow?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_10": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_11": "Nicole. Are you regretting this?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_13_12": "R-Regret? No!",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_14_01": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_14_02": "The kid's not here.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_14_03": "Must have been a ghost.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_14_04": "Stop it! There's no such thing as g-g-ghosts!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_14_05": "Boss, you're being a little loud...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_14_06": "A bunch of Ethereals heard you, and there're a lot of them! They're like strays waiting to get fed! Oh yeah!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_14_07": "Stop \"Oh yeah\"-ing! Cat food won't get rid of these monsters!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_14_08": "Don't worry, leave these guys to me!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_01": "That's it? These guys are surprisingly slow.",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_03": "How do you know?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_04": "I'm not a clueless stray. Judging the enemy is the most basic of skills.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_05": "Hmm... Something that can seriously injure multiple Ethereals... Billy, didn't you say a \"notorious\" Ethereal was in the Dead End Hollow?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_06": "That's right!\nAfter that I went to bribe some Investigators for info with cigarettes.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_07": "Can you even smoke cigarettes?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_08": "I can use my finger to light them for others.\nThey told me that notorious Ethereal is called the \"Dead End Butcher.\"\n",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_09": "The Dead End Butcher...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_10": "Not bad eh? Such a name could be the Starlight Knight's arch enemy! I'd love to see it... Ouch!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_11": "Then you can go alone!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_12": "You can deal with it yourself after meeting it, Billy.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_13": "I'm kidding... Our priority right now is to find that lost kid, then take care of business in the Red Fang Gang hideout!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_15_14": "You still remember our actual task? Impressive~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_01": "Boss... Can we really find the kid like this?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_02": "We'll end up getting lost at this rate~",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_03": "Don't worry. The Proxy assured me! As long as we don't stray too far from the tracks...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_04": "Nicole. The tracks ahead are broken.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_05": "What? Broken?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_06": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_07": "These huge claw marks... Could it be...?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_08": "In front of the Cunning Hares a huge rip has been torn through the tracks and platform as if it were made of cardboard.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_09": "Looking at it, nobody could imagine—",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_10": "the violent destruction that had taken place here.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_11": "...The Dead End Butcher...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_12": "We'll have to go back the way we came.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_13": "Hm? What's that over there...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_16_14": "...Ha. There's no way their guys are gonna stop us!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_01": "The graffiti here looks familiar.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_02": "If I'm not mistaken, I think we passed by here like an hour ago.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_03": "Nekomata's right. We saw that kid around here.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_04": "Anby agrees with me~ Is it gonna rain cats and dogs tomorrow?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_05": "I regret it. —Nicole, what's wrong with the graffiti on the wall?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_06": "Hmm... It looks familiar!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_07": "Yeah, we were here an hour ago...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_08": "I think it was longer than an hour ago...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_09": "Hmm... Yeah...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_10": "These are Red Fang Gang graffiti! I saw some just like it at the hideout a few days ago!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_11": "Are you sure? Gang graffiti so blatantly painted on a metro wall?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_12": "Before the old capital fell, normal people used to walk through here every day.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_13": "...So, did the Red Fang Gang have a close relationship with the capital's residents?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_14": "A close relationship... Were they lining up at the metro to collect protection money?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_15": "Hmm... It would be an efficient way to oppress people.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_16": "Nonsense! They wouldn't do such a thing!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_17": "Hm? You're familiar with the Red Fang Gang?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_18": "W-We've had our issues, otherwise my family's relic wouldn't have fallen into their hands.\nMore importantly, did you hear that? There's a kid running over there meow!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_19": "Really?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_17_20": "You can trust my hearing! It's coming from up ahead!",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_18_04": "Sorry! This isn't what I was expecting!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_18_05": "How about this. As it's my fault, you guys just leave this to me!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_18_06": "How could we...? Forget it, let's just get this over with!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_19_01": "...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_19_02": "Oh, you don't look too good, was that battle too hard for you?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_19_03": "It might be that way for you, but in my hometown we have to take out nine Ethereals like this just to go out and buy some mackerel!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_19_04": "Sounds like a real dangerous place...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_19_05": "I guess all hometowns are like that now...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_19_06": "We came here because you said you heard a child.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_19_07": "Nekomata. How are we supposed to trust you?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_19_08": "Forget it, Anby. Look over there.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_19_09": "Over there! Don't be afraid, we won't hurt you. Come over here...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_19_10": "Nobody's gonna come over being called by some weird robot dude.",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_20_07": "We've been seen! ...Phew, at least it isn't the big guy...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_20_08": "Must have heard us chasing the kid.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_20_09": "—Aaaah!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_20_10": "We're blocked in front too?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_20_11": "That kid is in danger, we have to hurry!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_01": "...How many are there?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_02": "At least over a hundred! Me and Anby only did a rough count of whoever was willing to come out to speak to us, there could be even more.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_03": "So many people... When is Vision planning to clear them out?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_04": "They say a Vision Corporation representative keeps telling them to wait for the next train.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_05": "It's already been almost a week.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_06": "Do you have a way to contact the outside world?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_07": "Anyone with a Bangboo has tried, but they couldn't call anyone. We're not even in a Hollow...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_08": "There's no signal? Ah! I saw a lot of high-powered transmitting gear when I went around asking. Could they be signal jammers?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_09": "What do you mean? They're deliberately blocking communication?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_10": "...It makes sense to install signal jammers at a confidential construction site, but...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_11": "—Caution, caution. Explosives arming is in the final stages. Technicians are in place and ready to seal the site. I repeat...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_12": "Seal it? Now?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_13": "...The Vision Corporation... Wait, everyone is still here? How can they seal the place with so many people here? What about the evacuation train?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_14": "Those bastards, they couldn't intend to...?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_15": "...\"Vision Corporation won the bid with a much lower cost advantage\", I remember them saying.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_16": "I get it... One of the big projects to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the city. It'll be technically and financially demanding, and they still have to relocate the residents.",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_17": "...But if Vision just dealt with the residents along with the demolition... It'd save costs.",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_19": "...Why...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_20": "How could they do such a thing...?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_21": "The Vision Corporation... Is there nothing they won't do to enter the TOPS Enterprises Union? And those Public Security troops are just hired cronies, right?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_22": "...So, what do you guys plan to do now?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_23": "Eughh~ I didn't expect this when I took on the commission...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_24": "I just wanted to earn some extra cash while doing our investigation, how did we end up getting involved in a conspiracy? This isn't the kind of opponent an odd-job agency goes against...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_25": "You two... What do you think?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_26": "I'll do whatever you say Boss, but Anby...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_27": "I'm staying. I understand Nicole's thinking, but I can't follow this time. This is my chance. I won't make the same mistake again...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_28": "Really... Going against a corporation. Anby, you really are...",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_29": "—a girl after my own heart!",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_32": "Don't just stand there! Get everyone to sign the authorization forms! Collect them one by one!",

  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_35": "You want to save everyone trapped here right?\nMy finances, uhh, and the safety of everyone here is relying on you!",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_36": "Huh? But I'm just a client who hasn't even paid a deposit... Are you sure you can trust me with such an important task?",
  "Galgame_Chapter1_27_37": "You know the area, and you're the most agile. Here, take my Bangboo.",

It is a documentary that presents viewers with what the world looked like before the disaster as well as how people lived their lives. There was a time when this documentary was banned after a boycott led by a company in Eridu. The reason for the ban was that \"The collection showed people a rosy past that did not exist. It creates an unrealistic image of what the world outside Eridu is like and is thus a threat to people's safety.\" It started to be released again after swarms of fans protested.\nOne important motive for the protagonist to start a music store was to collect all sorts of banned audio-visual materials.",

  "VHSTrending_Desc_21002": "When it comes to fantasy films, people always think of ancient castles, swords, and magic. Boring! Can't we have magic in modern times? Have you got anything that combines fantasy stories with a modern setting? It's gotta have exciting fight scenes, too!",

  "VHSTrending_Desc_27002": "I'm all out of inspiration! Without that, a chef isn't worth his salt! I'd love something surprising; something that makes me cry or sweat.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_28002": "I'm a fan of skyscrapers and love snapping pics of urban scenes. But security always turns me away when I show up with my camera. I can only look at the urban backgrounds in films... The grand buildings... The exquisite architecture...",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_29002": "My in-store Bangboo is dumb, and keeps spouting the same lines. I can't think of a cool slogan to program it with, so no new customers are showing up. I need something about the lives and hobbies of young people. It'd help me a lot!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_30002": "I love New Eridu because it changes every day! I bet there are many just like me recording these changes to different media. Perhaps it's a documentary, or maybe it's just a casual daily vlog. Have you got any tapes like that for me?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_31002": "I once heard a quote that \"People cannot even imagine what has never been seen before.\" Is that true, though? I want to refute it, but I'm afraid it's true... Even films of the imagination must have their limits.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_32002": "Being home alone on weekends is boring. I wanna watch some videos that'll make me laugh. All the better if it has a rich plot and shows a slice of life.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_33002": "Make me laugh; amaze me with the incredible; make me feel good about the hero's character development. I've got very clear parameters here. Please can I borrow something like that?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_34002": "I found some old photos of grandpa while cleaning and grew suddenly curious. I wanna watch more films from that era to see what things were like when grandpa was growing up.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_35002": "Ugh, my partner is finally coming round to my place for a date! Have you got anything that can bring two lovers closer together?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_36002": "It's a little embarrassing to mention, but I've been dreaming lots recently about a prince on a white horse proposing to me... Have you got anything similar? Teehee, it doesn't have to be a prince, and he doesn't have to ride a white horse — so long as there's a happy ending~",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_37002": "My classmate thinks they're braver than me. They have no idea who they're dealing with! I need to find a thriller, the scarier the better. We'll sort out the winner at midnight!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_38002": "Why is it the detectives always die together with the bad guy in all the whodunits that I read? Is an unhappy ending really the best match for a suspense movie..?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_39002": "We're going on a school trip soon and are going to be bunking together. I want to bring a thrilling, mind-bending, or shocking movie!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_1003": "My classmate thinks they're braver than me. They have no idea who they're dealing with! I need to find a thriller, the scarier the better. We'll sort out the winner at midnight!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_2003": "They're always showing action movies on the screen at my gym, and it really gives me a good workout! I'm looking for something similar to watch so I can workout at home, too. Something with a sinister and depressing atmosphere might help me build up my washboard abs!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_3003": "You can become desensitized from watching too many zombie movies. It's not that they're not exciting. It's just that they're always dawdling so slowly and always look the same... It would be cool if more elements could be integrated, like super-fast punching zombies, or zombies that can cause natural disasters...",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_4003": "I finally freed up some time, but somehow the cinema is undergoing renovations all week?! No way. I'm not wasting a chance for a date. I need to find a good romantic movie for couples.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_5003": "Things were better in the past. It may have been tough going, but it can't be forgotten...",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_6003": "Well, I got dumped again, but there's no way it's my fault... Dating has never been smooth sailing, not since ancient times. There must have been many tragic love stories before me, right?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_7003": "I like watching anything, but my absolute favorites are comedies. It's human nature to pursue happiness! At least, it's in my nature...",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_8003": "Every time I see a construction Bangboo, I wonder what it would be like if we let Bangboo build their own city? I'd love to see what that's like — all kinds of curious creatures living together. Would it be better than New Eridu?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_9003": "I love those urban lifestyle movies where they get a superpower and it leads to a series of funny events. They're original and funny!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_10003": "Argh! I couldn't squeeze onto the metro; I'm late for work; I spilt my drink at lunch; and I got called back for an evening meeting! Everything's gone terrible today. Quick, gimme a hearty fighting movie to let off some steam!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_11003": "After several days of corporate schmoozing, I can't stand the sight of a fake smile any more and never want to drink again... Please, give me a movie about city life that helps me rediscover my smile.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_12003": "Action movies don't have to be filled with explosions and blood, right? I like action-comedy movies more, with all their wacky hijinks — they're straight up fun",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_13003": "I like watching anything, but my absolute favorites are comedies. It's human nature to pursue happiness! At least, it's in my nature...",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_14003": "I saw this model wearing classical clothes and it completely redefined my perspective on fashion. Every era has its own fashion labels. I'm curious: How did people view fashion in times gone by?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_15003": "If I could turn back time 10 years, I'd warn myself not to stay up all night watching videos. Speaking of which... got any good videos? Something that links up the past and the present; something that makes people laugh, but also leaves plenty to think about?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_16003": "I'm tired of watching flashy blockbusters, I want something more realistic and simple, a more original film!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_17003": "My folks are coming to stay. What kind of video is suitable to watch together? Something not too light and it shouldn't be impractical.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_18003": "I'd like to know... to know more about the real truth of this world. Those unknown tales that happen right under your nose, told straight with no exaggeration. You must have something like that here.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_19003": "Recently, I always feel as if I've seen the spreadsheets open on my screen before. Am I just locked in a loop, doing the same mundane work every day? I don't wanna stay the same forever... I want to face fresh new challenges.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_20003": "Dad wants to watch a scary movie, but mom wants to watch something serious and plot-driven. It's a real pain... I hardly ever visit the family home. Have you got anything they'd both like watching?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_21003": "This is kinda embarrassing, but I like watching horror movies during daytime hours... I don't have much planned this weekend. Can you please give me some recommendations for an exciting movie? But please, nothing too over-the-top.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_22003": "I once heard a quote that \"People cannot even imagine what has never been seen before.\" Is that true, though? I want to refute it, but I'm afraid it's true... Even films of the imagination must have their limits.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_23003": "We had to move house because of expanding Hollows eating up our old place. But I don't care! Just stay positive, and you can beat anything! Can you give me a similar movie? I wanna take it home and watch it with my family to inspire them.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_24003": "I'm going on a mission into a Hollow soon, and I heard that as long as you stay relaxed and in a positive frame of mind that the effects of Ether corruption are minimized. Whether it's true or not, I've decided to find a movie and try it out. I'm just after a video that can keep me in good spirits even when faced with unimaginable terror.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_25003": "I once heard a quote that \"People cannot even imagine what has never been seen before.\" Is that true, though? I want to refute it, but I'm afraid it's true... Even films of the imagination must have their limits.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_26003": "I just saw this promo video for New Eridu and I've never been more in love with this city! Please can you recommend some similar documentaries? The more the better!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_27003": "I'm so curious as to what this land here was like before the settlement of New Eridu! And what about other cities? I'm looking for something that faithfully recounts some of our hometown's features that I might not have noticed before.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_28003": "I'm one of those people who don't want to think about the plot of detective stories and just want to know what the ending is like. But afterwards, I still go back and watch the different layers and plotlines crisscross each other.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_29003": "My daughter is addicted to watching horror movies, but she's a chicken and covers her ears and eyes when anything tense happens. Can you recommend a horror movie? Doesn't matter what, her eyes are closed anyway. Oh yeah — I hope there're a few family scenes so that she's not too alienated from me.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_30003": "Under true terror, friendships and romances may be betrayed — but not family love. Every movie I've ever seen has been like this. Do your videos support my thesis — or perhaps you can change my mind?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_31003": "I'm one of those people who don't want to think about the plot of detective stories and just want to know what the ending is like. But afterwards, I still go back and watch the different layers and plotlines crisscross each other.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_32003": "I applied to join the Hollow Investigative Association — not for fame and fortune, but to protect my family when danger comes. Can you please recommend me something that can pep me up?",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_33003": "My gym bought a big new TV recently and I want to put some tough guy movies up on the screen. You know the kind: a renegade tough guy goes up against a shady organization and has to protect a VIP. And of course, he's as buff as a body-builder!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_34003": "The secret of youth is to be curious about everything! You must have loads of novelty stuff here; not just videotapes themselves, but the contents, of course. Let me see! I wanna see them all!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_35003": "Argh, insomnia is the worst... I had two cups of coffee, so now I'm tired AND I can't sleep. Have you got any easy-going movies that I can just zombie out to? Hopefully it'll get me through this patch of insomnia.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_36003": "I want to borrow something to watch over a meal. The content has to be original and fun, otherwise I can't eat. Nothing that's too long, either, because I don't really eat that much.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_37003": "I found some old photos of grandpa while cleaning and grew suddenly curious. I wanna watch more films from that era to see what things were like when grandpa was growing up.",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_38003": "My work is driving me crazy! I've put in 3 days of overtime and adjusted the ad campaign ten times already, but the feedback is that the first version was still better?! Gah! I need some inspiration!",
  "VHSTrending_Desc_39003": "I really admire those who used to live in this beautiful old city long ago. Life was slow, and personalities were kept to oneself. They don't have to be talking too much; just one look will leave me with an everlasting taste of those times.",
